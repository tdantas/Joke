Joke minimal Rake for fun #irresponsibleruby

Once upon a time ....  
A good friend asked me to help him to implement a Build tool, for his Job Interview. *GL my friend*  
The recruiters were interested in your ability to build Tests Driven and how you handle Recursion. ( My thoughts ). 

I told him:
  Why not some use Topological Sort (more generic approach ) to impress the recruiters ? 
  On the other hand build one simple recursion just to solve the dependencies.
  
 He choose the second option :) Smart Boy !
 He accomplish the interview and is waiting for the response.

This challenger give me one "creative, irresponsible" idea. Mimic the Rake. I called Joke :)  
So, where could I try to implement that ? 
  everyday on my journey to the job I waste 45 minutes so I decided to build this 'tool' for fun :)
