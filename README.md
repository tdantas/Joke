Joke minimal Rake for fun #irresponsibleruby

Once upon a time ....  
A good friend asked me to help him to implement a Build tool, for his Job Interview. *GL my friend*  
The challenger was interested in your ability to build tests and how you handle recursion.

I told him, you could use Topological Sort (more generic approach ) or build one simple specific recursion just to solve the dependencies.

So what next ?  

everyday on my journey to the job I waste 45 minutes so I decided to build this 'tool' for fun :)

#### TODO
 - Tests
 - Fix MANY MANY Bugs
 - Have fun
